# Overview

The web app that I made is for connecting with a database and displaying employee information within a company. It also uses user authentication to make sure that the salary information is only accessed by the correct users. If someone is not logged in then they will not be able to see that information. 

I created this web app so that I could learn more about Django and how I could use a database for retrieving and storing information. I also wanted to learn how to use a login system so that certain information could only be accessed with an account.

# Web Pages

The web pages that I created for this project start with displaying a list of employees in a database. Then the user can choose the name that they want to see the information for and it will redirect them to the page with their information. 

# Development Environment
